## Vision ðŸš€
Trivia Duel aims to be more than just another trivia game; we aspire to revolutionize the way trivia is played and consumed. We fuse the traditional elements of trivia with the cutting-edge capabilities of machine learning. Our goal is to provide endless, dynamic content while also ensuring competitive machine-player interactions in the future.

### Point and Time System:

    Players earn points based on both the correctness and response time. The faster you answer, the higher you score!

### Leaderboard:

    Keep track of your scores and see how you stack up against other players.

## Future Implementations:
### LLMM (Language Learning Machine Model) Integration:

- Automatic Question Generation: Say goodbye to static question banks. Our system will generate new questions continually, ensuring a fresh experience every time you play. This was implemented in the `ai-merged` branch.

- Play Against the Machine: Think you're a trivia champion? Test your mettle against our AI, which will not only pose questions but also play against you!

### Social Features:
Challenge friends, join tournaments, and participate in global trivia events.

### Learning Mode:
